As a top-tier security expert, your mission is to analyze the provided source code and its corresponding CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) information to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

Follow these instructions:
1.  **Understand the CWE**: First, thoroughly review the provided CWE information. It describes the general characteristics, examples, and mitigation methods for this type of vulnerability.
2.  **Analyze the Code**: Scrutinize the provided source code line by line, looking for patterns that match the vulnerability described in the CWE.
3.  **Report Your Findings**: Format your analysis in a JSON object that strictly adheres to the schema specified in `The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

````.
    *   `"is_vulnerable"`: Explicitly state `true` or `false` to indicate whether you found the CWE vulnerability in the code.
    *   `"vulnerability_reason"`: If you identified a vulnerability, provide a detailed and logical explanation of **why you believe it is vulnerable**. Clearly explain which lines of code violate the CWE principles and how. If you believe it is not vulnerable, briefly explain why.
    *   `"vulnerable_code_snippet"`: Include the exact code snippets that are directly related to the vulnerability. If the vulnerability spans multiple sections, include all of them. If no vulnerability is found, leave this field empty.

Your analysis must be accurate, well-reasoned, and practical, enabling developers to immediately understand and address the issue.
