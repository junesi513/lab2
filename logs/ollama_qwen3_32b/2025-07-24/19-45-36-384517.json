    "justification": "The code does not directly deserialize untrusted binary data. It performs JSON-to-Java object conversion using FastJSON, which is inherently different from Java's object deserialization (CWE-502). However, if the application allows untrusted input to control the component type, it could introduce a vulnerability. As written, the code does not demonstrate a direct CWE-502 issue."
