    "most_relevant_cwe": "CWE-41",
    "analysis_result": "The provided code does not handle file path operations or path equivalence logic. The code focuses on JSON serialization/deserialization of object arrays and does not process user-controlled file paths that could be exploited via path equivalence attacks (e.g., using special characters like `../`). While the code uses reflection and dynamic type handling, there is no evidence of improper path resolution that would align with CWE-41 or its parent category (CWE-706).",

    "recommendation": "No specific fixes are required for this code regarding CWE-41. However, ensure that any future file path handling includes proper validation and normalization of inputs to prevent path traversal or equivalence attacks."
