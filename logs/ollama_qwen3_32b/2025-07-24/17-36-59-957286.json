    "vulnerability_reason": "The provided code handles object array serialization/deserialization in Fastjson, but contains no logic related to file path resolution, path equivalence, or directory traversal. The code manipulates Java arrays and type metadata during JSON processing, which is unrelated to the file system path equivalence vulnerability described in CWE-41. No path traversal patterns (e.g., './', '../') or file system operations are present in the code.",
