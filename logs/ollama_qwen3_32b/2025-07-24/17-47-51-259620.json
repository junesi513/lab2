    "most_relevant_cwe": "CWE-41",
    "analysis_result": "The code does not handle file path operations or path equivalence resolution. It focuses on JSON serialization/deserialization of object arrays, which is unrelated to the file system path manipulation described in CWE-41. No path traversal or equivalence resolution logic is present in the provided code.",
    "vulnerable_code_lines": [],
    "recommendation": "Since this code is not vulnerable to CWE-41, no changes are required. However, ensure proper validation of input data during deserialization to prevent other potential issues like arbitrary object instantiation or denial-of-service attacks in JSON processing libraries."
