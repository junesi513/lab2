An adversary could supply a filename like ""-aR"", producing the ""ls -l -aR"" command (CWE-88), thereby getting a full recursive listing of the entire directory and all of its sub-directories. There are a couple possible mitigations for this weakness. One would be to refactor the code to avoid using system() altogether, instead relying on internal functions. Another option could be to add a ""--"" argument to the ls command, such as ""ls -l --"", so that any remaining arguments are treated as filenames, causing any leading ""-"" to be treated as part of a filename instead of another option. Another fix might be to change the regular expression used in validate_name to force the first character of the filename to be a letter or number, such as:"
