This means that an attacker could replace the intended file with a file containing arbitrary malicious code that will be executed when the button is pressed. In the corrected code, we have overridden the readObject() method inside the ObjectInputStream to always throw an IOException with the message \\\"Cannot be deserialized\\\". This ensures that no object can be deserialized from the file, thus protecting against deserialization attacks. If a deserialization attempt is made, an error message will be printed out in the console, warning the user of the attempt."

        "description": "The vulnerability in the code is due to the use of the 'cPickle.loads()' function. cPickle is known to be unsafe as it allows the execution of arbitrary Python objects, which might include malicious code within. An attacker could potentially deliver a crafted token that when deserialized, spawns a new process, that could run arbitrary code on the system. To fix the issue, the cPickle has been replaced by JSON for deserialization. JSON has a strict data model and doesn't allow for the execution of server-side code unlike cPickle. This mitigates the risk by ensuring that only valid data is loaded and any attacker attempts to execute arbitrary code would fail."
