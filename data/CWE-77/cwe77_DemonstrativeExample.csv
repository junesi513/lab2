There are a couple possible mitigations for this weakness. One would be to refactor the code to avoid using system() altogether, instead relying on internal functions. Another option could be to add a ""--"" argument to the ls command, such as ""ls -l --"", so that any remaining arguments are treated as filenames, causing any leading ""-"" to be treated as part of a filename instead of another option.

Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form ""& del c:\\dbms\\*.*"", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well."
