95,DX-31,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"The script intends to take the 'action' parameter and invoke one of a variety of functions based on the value of that parameter - config_file_add_key(), config_file_set_key(), or config_file_delete_key(). It could set up a conditional to invoke each function separately, but eval() is a powerful way of doing the same thing in fewer lines of code, especially when a large number of functions or variables are involved. Unfortunately, in this case, the attacker can provide other values in the action parameter, such as:"

```",NULL

95,DX-31,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Any arbitrary Perl code could be added after the attacker has ""closed off"" the construction of the original function call, in order to prevent parsing errors from causing the malicious eval() to fail before the attacker's payload is activated. This particular manipulation would fail after the system() call, because the ""_key(\$fname, \$key, \$val)"" portion of the string would cause an error, but this is irrelevant to the attack because the payload has already been activated."
95,DX-156,1,This simple script asks a user to supply a list of numbers as input and adds them together.,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

95,DX-156,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"The eval() function can take the user-supplied list and convert it into a Python list object, therefore allowing the programmer to use list comprehension methods to work with the data. However, if code is supplied to the eval() function, it will execute that code. For example, a malicious user could supply the following string:"

95,DX-156,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"A way to accomplish this without the use of eval() is to apply an integer conversion on the input within a try/except block. If the user-supplied input is not numeric, this will raise a ValueError. By avoiding eval(), there is no opportunity for the input string to be executed as code."

95,DX-156,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"An alternative, commonly-cited mitigation for this kind of weakness is to use the ast.literal_eval() function, since it is intentionally designed to avoid executing code. However, an adversary could still cause excessive memory or stack consumption via deeply nested structures [REF-1372], so the python documentation discourages use of ast.literal_eval() on untrusted data [REF-1373]."
