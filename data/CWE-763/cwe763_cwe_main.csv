0,763,Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference,"The product attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but it calls the wrong release function or calls the appropriate release function incorrectly.","This weakness can take several forms, such as: - The memory was allocated, explicitly or implicitly, via one memory management method and deallocated using a different, non-compatible function (CWE-762). - The function calls or memory management routines chosen are appropriate, however they are used incorrectly, such as in CWE-761."
