0,20,Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.","Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. Input can consist of: - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc. - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data. Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as: - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc. - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc. - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be) - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc. - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation."
