0,395,Use of NullPointerException Catch to Detect NULL Pointer Dereference,Catching NullPointerException should not be used as an alternative to programmatic checks to prevent dereferencing a null pointer.,"Programmers typically catch NullPointerException under three circumstances: - The program contains a null pointer dereference. Catching the resulting exception was easier than fixing the underlying problem. - The program explicitly throws a NullPointerException to signal an error condition. - The code is part of a test harness that supplies unexpected input to the classes under test. Of these three circumstances, only the last is acceptable."
